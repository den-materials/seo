## Basic Steps
### Use [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/webmasters/googleforwebmasters/) as your main resource.
How Google crawls and indexes your site is constantly changing, and there are TONS of tools that they provide that you should look into, like:
* [Search Console](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6258314?hl=en&ref_topic=3309469)
* [Analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics/analytics/#?modal_active=none)
* [Mobile-friendly test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
* [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/)

## PageRank
One of the founding tools Google used to rank sites (why it eventually became a verb) is called PageRank. It's their patented algorithm, and you can [read all about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank). It's based on _how many other sites link to yours_.
